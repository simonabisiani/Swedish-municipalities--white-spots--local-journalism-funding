# Swedish municipalities, blank spots and Local Journalism in Sweden

Code for my Master's thesis for the MSc in Computational Social Science (Linkoping University, Sweden). 

The repository contains all the code used to run the study, alongside some useful data structures needed to conduct the research: municipality data (retrieved on https://www.scb.se/en/finding-statistics/regional-statistics/regional-divisions/counties-and-municipalities/), newsrooms in Sweden (retrieved on https://kommundatabas.mediestudier.se/) and reception of funding for local journalism in Sweden in 2019 and 2020 (retrieved from https://www.mprt.se/).
